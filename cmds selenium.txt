While using the class in the python file

we will import the module name "unittest"

at first we will create the class named as setup class


After that we will create another function name "test_logion_valid"
        for the applying credentials in the login page


and finally we will create the function 
        as tearDownClass


keeping in mind 
'''
tearDown(self) will run after every test and 
tearDown class will run only once(after all the test has been completed)

'''
