While using the class in the python file

we will import the module name "unittest"

at first we will create the class named as setup class


After that we will create another function name "test_logion_valid"
        for the applying credentials in the login page


and finally we will create the function 
        as tearDownClass


keeping in mind 
'''
tearDown(self) will run after every test and 
tearDown class will run only once(after all the test has been completed)

'''


configure the python scripting by "Edit Configuration Menu"
in that select the module name as class name for "example -> LoginTest(unittest.TestCase)



    if we will add the "   if __name == '__main__'   " :
                            then in the command prompt we will not use the python -m unittest program_name.py
                            in that case we will not use the "-m" ->flag
                            we will simply call the python cmd for the intrepeture
                                i,e python program_name.py
